# Water Molecule Counting in Lipid Membranes

This script counts the number of water molecules between the upper and lower halves of a lipid membrane in each frame of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory.

## Description

The script uses the MDAnalysis library to process the trajectory and calculate the number of water molecules located between the upper and lower halves of the membrane for each frame in the trajectory. 
It also provides options for saving residue IDs, calculating mean and error, and plotting the data.

Originally, this script is used for calculating water molecules inside the hydrophobic core of a lipid membrane. To estimate the number of water molecules in the hydrophobic core (in the region of lipid tails), 
we used the following simple method. We defined the boundaries of the hydrophobic core using the C32 and C22 carbon atoms of lipids (first C-atoms after carboxyl group for each lipid). 
For each frame of the MD trajectory, the minimum distance r between C-atoms of different half-layers is determined. Then we select molecules which distances to each half-layer is less than r. 
Indeed, this is only possible for those water molecules that are located within these boundaries. 
All water molecules outside the membrane will have a greater distance than r to one or another layer of C-atoms.

`-step` &emsp;&emsp; <step> &emsp;&emsp; (1)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Interval for frame-based analysis.  
`-ts` &emsp;&emsp; <time step>  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Time step interval for analysis.   
`--calc`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Flag to calculate mean and error of the results.  
`--plot`  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Flag to plot the data.  

## Output

The output file water_mols.csv will contain the number of water molecules between the upper and lower halves of the membrane for each frame.
If the --save_resids flag is used, a file resids.csv will be created with the residue IDs of the water molecules for each frame.
